This folder contains a migrate4j.properties file that allows
testing migrate4j against an Oracle database.  Copy this file
into the test directory to make migrate4j use your test Oracle database.

To set up your test Oracle database, please complete the following steps:

1)  Open a shell
2)  Log into Oracle:
		[user@hostname ~]$ sqlplus sys/<password> as sysdba
3)  Run the following commands:
		SQL> CREATE USER "MIGRATE4J" PROFILE "DEFAULT" IDENTIFIED BY "MIGRATE4J" DEFAULT TABLESPACE "USERS" TEMPORARY TABLESPACE "TEMP" ACCOUNT UNLOCK;
		SQL> GRANT "DBA" TO "MIGRATE4J";
		SQL> EXIT
		
Note:  The "[user@hostname ~]$" represents a shell prompt while "SQL>" represents
		an Oracle SQL*Plus prompt
		
You only need to complete these steps once.  After you have completed
these steps, the tests should run without any additional work.
